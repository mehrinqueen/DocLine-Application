# DocLine-Application
The name of our mobile application is DocLine which is basically a helpline where patients can get their appointment with doctors online, and they can also call or chat with the doctors about their problems for prior consultancy and suggestions. This application is built to reduce the crowd in hospitals which can be very unhealthy. Our application aims to make a patient's life easier by providing the necessary information while they are at home. We have included all kinds of features in this application through which the patients will find it very straightforward and easy to use since this application is for patients or emergency-related. Our expected result is to get full satisfaction from all the patients or users. We will try to achieve such a result by taking all the recommendations and feedback into our account and improve the application accordingly.
